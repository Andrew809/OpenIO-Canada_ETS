_Comparison openIO-Canada v2.7 and v2.8 results for the GWP scores for the whole Canadian economy in 2019:_
- Consumption approach
  - v2.7 estimates at 681MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada
  - v2.8 estimates at 650MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada
- Production-based approach
  - v2.7 estimates at 814MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada
  - v2.7 estimates at 795MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada

The difference between the two versions come from corrections in the GHG physical flow accounts by Statistics Canada's 
team and from the fact that in 2.8 aggregated GHG accounts are used. These aggregated accounts are based on less 
conservative characterization factors compared to the ones from v2.7. Hence the general decrease observed in the results.


_Comparing aggregated GWP scores from openIO-Canada v2.7 for the whole Canadian economy using consumption-based and 
production-based approaches, with Canadian GWP scores from Exiobase3.8.2 2019 and Eora26 results for 2018 (latest year available)_

- Consumption-based approach
  - openIO-Canada estimates at 681MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada
  - exiobase estimates at 697MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada, which corresponds to a difference of **+2.3%** compared 
  to openIO-Canada
  - eora26 estimates at 721MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada, which corresponds to a difference of **+5.8%** compared to 
  openIO-Canada
- Production-based approach
  - openIO-Canada estimates at 814MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada
  - exiobase estimates at 833MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada, which corresponds to a difference of **+2.3%** compared 
  to openIO-Canada
  - eora26 estimates at 722MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada, which corresponds to a difference of **-11.3%** compared to 
  openIO-Canada
  - the official number from the Canadian government estimates at 730MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada, which 
  corresponds to a difference of **-10.3%** compared to openIO-Canada
