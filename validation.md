_Comparison openIO-Canada v2.7 and v2.8 results for the GWP scores for the whole Canadian economy in 2019:_
- Consumption approach
  - v2.7 estimates at 681MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada
  - v2.8 estimates at 650MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada
  - v2.9 estimates at 660MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada
- Production-based approach
  - v2.7 estimates at 814MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada
  - v2.8 estimates at 795MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada
  - v2.9 estimates at 802MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada

In the v2.9, we have access to disaggregated GHG accounts once again. Characterization factors applied were thus updated
from the IPCC AR5 to IPCC AR6, explaining the slight increase observed between v2.8 and v2.9. Numbers from the v2.9 are 
still under numbers from v2.7 because v2.7 was relying on the conservative characterization factors of the AR5, which 
were higher than the new numbers from the AR6.


_Comparing aggregated GWP scores from openIO-Canada v2.7 for the whole Canadian economy using consumption-based and 
production-based approaches, with Canadian GWP scores from Exiobase3.8.2 2019 and Eora26 results for 2018 (latest year available)_

- Consumption-based approach
  - openIO-Canada estimates at 681MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada
  - exiobase estimates at 697MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada, which corresponds to a difference of **+2.3%** compared 
  to openIO-Canada
  - eora26 estimates at 721MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada, which corresponds to a difference of **+5.8%** compared to 
  openIO-Canada
- Production-based approach
  - openIO-Canada estimates at 814MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada
  - exiobase estimates at 833MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada, which corresponds to a difference of **+2.3%** compared 
  to openIO-Canada
  - eora26 estimates at 722MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada, which corresponds to a difference of **-11.3%** compared to 
  openIO-Canada
  - the official number from the Canadian government estimates at 730MtCO2e the total footprint of Canada, which 
  corresponds to a difference of **-10.3%** compared to openIO-Canada. Difference comes from the reporting frameworks
  (UNFCCC vs SEEA)
